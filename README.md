### I am Henrie Friesen (he/him),
A quick-learning software engineer experienced in backend development and legacy code refactoring dedicated to continually learning and leveraging best practices such as design patterns, test-driven development, and SOLID principles to create great products.

### Experience
#### Fiserv
At Fiserv, I have designed new features and refactored complex legacy code in a codebase with hundreds of thousands of lines into modern Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) standards using design patterns and SOLID principles (self-learning) to enhance system architecture and reduce technical debt, led team unit testing and database query enhancement efforts, automated account clearing processes to save hours of work for bank employees every month, and become a go-to backend developer both within my team and throughout client services.

Written in OpenEdge ABL, an older language created to be used to develop business applications by people who were not primarily developers, the backend is massive, tightly coupled, and largely procedural. ABL examples are hard to come by and documentation is often lacking, so I have learned to write performant, maintainable code on the fly under difficult circumstances. While I have education in cutting-edge languages and design principles, both from my degree and self-taught, I have learned that the language is not important - it is the committment to writing clean, tested, performant, and maintainable code that creates great products.

#### CS Department Assistant System Administration, Carleton College
Through my CS Assistant System Administrator position, I gained experience with the command line, shell scripting in Bash and Zsh, and Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

### Education
I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a B.A. in Computer Science from Carleton College, '23.

Through my courses, I gained experience with algorithms, data structures, mathematics of CS, statistics, computer systems, and software design. In them, I have completed projects using:
- Python (Django, Flask)
- HTML & CSS
- Java
- C and x86-64 Assembly
- Scheme
- R

### Projects
#### Carleton Geothermal Full-Stack Application ([check it out!](https://github.com/acdalal/geothermal)) 
I worked on a 6-member team to create a full-stack web application to enable stakeholders to access Carleton's wealth of geothermal data. My responsibilities and achievements included:
- Pioneering a data access pipeline to Carleton’s Geothermal Database with a team of 6 by using Python Django, PostgreSQL, and HTML/CSS to build a database API and graphical user interface
- Strengthening solutions to frontend and backend design challenges by prototyping user interfaces in Figma
- Integrating direct stakeholder feedback into development by maintaining user stories and requirements

#### Scheme Interpreter using C
- Developed a Scheme interpreter using C that passes 100% of assigned tests, including Donald Knuth’s ‘Man or Boy’ test
- Ensured code accuracy and consistency in a pair-programming setting by making hundreds of programmatic diagram illustrations and in-depth documentation
