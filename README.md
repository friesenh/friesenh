### I am Henrie Friesen (he/him),
- Passionate about using my tech knowledge for projects that promote social good and combat pressing global issues
- A Magna Cum Laude Computer Science graduate from Carleton College in Northfield, MN (2023)
- I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities. I am a committed developer, an eager learner and a versatile team player with strong communication and collaboration skills and am excited to apply my CS skills to solve real-world problems

### Projects
#### Carleton Geothermal Full-Stack Application
I worked on a 6-member team to create a full-stack web application to enable stakeholders to access Carleton's wealth of geothermal data. My responsibilities and achievements included:
- Pioneering a data access pipeline to Carleton’s Geothermal Database with a team of 6 by using Python Django, PostgreSQL, and HTML/CSS to build a database API and graphical user interface
