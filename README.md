### I am Henrie Friesen (he/him),
- Passionate about using my knowledge and interest for ML/AI, cloud computing, robotics and cutting edge technology for projects that promote social good and combat pressing global issues such as climate change
- A Computer Science Undergraduate Student at Carleton College in Northfield, MN
- I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities for starting the summer of 2023. I am a quick and eager learner, and am excited to apply my CS education to solve real-world problems.

### Projects and Experience
#### Carleton College
Through my CS Assistant System Administrator position, I've gained experience with the command line, shell scripting in Bash and Zsh, and Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Through my courses at Carleton, I've gained experience with topics in algorithms, data structures, mathematics of CS, statistics, and computer systems. In them, I have coded and completed projects using:
- Python
- Java
- C and x86-64 Assembly
- Scheme
- R

Some of my favorite projects have included:
- Building a Scheme interpreter using C
- This [Frogger-Style game](https://github.com/friesenh/CS111FinalGame) created for my CS 111 final project (Python)
- A program which finds the shortest sequence of "Wikipedia" articles between a source and destination page using graph traversals (Java)
- A "code attack" project wherein we exploited vulnerable C programs using code-injection and return-oriented programming attack techniques (C, x86-64 Assembly, debugging with GDB)
#### Personal
I am excited to work on personal projects going forward. Some of my ideas include:
- A [fantasy football draft helper](https://github.com/friesenh/Fantasy-Football-Assistant) which, using ML techniques, scrapes sites containing individual players' statistics and team matchup data to provide recommendations of players to draft in fantasy football leagues.
- A program which, using species-specific data and past planting and yield data, recommends which plant species' to plant in specific locations in my family backyard garden in order to maximize yield and soil health.
- A database and interactive frontend which stores food recipes and allows users to search for close-matching recipes based on a combination of available ingredients, preparation time, type of cuisine, etc.
