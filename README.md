### I am Henrie Friesen (he/him),
- Passionate about using my tech knowledge for projects that promote social good and combat pressing global issues
- A Computer Science Undergraduate Student at Carleton College in Northfield, MN, graduating in June 2023
- I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities for starting the summer of 2023. I am a committed student, an eager learner and a versatile team player with strong communication and collaboration skills and am excited to apply my CS skills to solve real-world problems

### Projects
#### Carleton Geothermal Full-Stack Application
I am currently working on a 6-member team to create a full-stack web application to enable stakeholders to access Carleton's wealth of geothermal data. My responsibilities and achievements include:
- Pioneer a data access pipeline to Carleton’s Geothermal Database with a team of 6 by using Python Django, PostgreSQL, and HTML/CSS to build a database API and graphical user interface
- Strengthen solutions to frontend and backend design challenges by prototyping user interfaces in Figma
- Integrate direct stakeholder feedback into development by maintaining user stories and requirements

#### Scheme Interpreter using C
- Developed a Scheme interpreter using C that passes 100% of assigned tests, including Donald Knuth’s ‘Man or Boy’ test
- Ensured code accuracy and consistency in a pair-programming setting by making hundreds of programmatic diagram illustrations and in-depth documentation

### Education and Work Experience
Through my CS Assistant System Administrator position, I've gained experience with the command line, shell scripting in Bash and Zsh, and Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Through my courses at Carleton, I've gained experience with topics in algorithms, data structures, mathematics of CS, statistics, and computer systems. In them, I have coded and completed projects using:
- Python
- Java
- C and x86-64 Assembly
- Scheme
- R

### Future
I am very excited to continue learning and growing as an engineer. My goals include:
- Gain industry experience in using my tech skills to work towards ends that will benefit our local, state, national, and international communities
- Continue developing a personal portfolio website using the MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node) tech stack
- Work on personal projects that follow my interests. One project I'm excited to work on in the future that combines my culinary and tech interests is a full-stack application which stores food recipes and allows users to search for close-matching recipes based on a combination of available ingredients, preparation time, type of cuisine, etc.
